                There has been an increase in eye problems in children, especially after the pandemic
                 as they go back to school. Dr AK Grover, chairman, Vision Eye Centres, Delhi, tells us 
                 why that may be the case.</p>

                    The school labs are well-equipped as well as spacious and are efficiently utilized.

                    practical knowledge to the students which helps them in better understanding of concepts.</p>

                        A teaching & learning policy is also an extremely helpful document to present when a school is being inspected by Ofsted. The policy helps to outline how the school plans its curriculum, and the plans they have in place to implement it.
