        <h3>EVENT INFORMATION</h3>
        <P>
                Getting parents involved is no easy task.<br> 
                But Education World's "Principal Files" team offers some great ideas for school-wide events <br>
                that are sure to draw parents in large numbers. <br>
                Included: More than 30 events to add to your school calendar!<br>
                Any day of the school year is a great day for a special event! <br>
                There are BINGO Nights and Spaghetti Suppers and Field Days and Book Sales...<br>
                The list of super-special events is a mile long.<br> 
                That's why we asked our Principal Files team to share with us some of the events
                they hold each year that get kids involved and parents interested.<br>
                The calendar below offers a couple dozen great ideas they shared plus links<br>
                to many additional ideas from the Education World archive.<br> 
                Any one of these events is sure to result in great parent turnout,<br> 
                and many provide fun events for entire families.
